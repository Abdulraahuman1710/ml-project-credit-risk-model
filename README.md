# Credit Risk Classification Model
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Credit Risk Classification Model to predict the likelihood of credit default. The model uses a dataset of financial features and outcomes, providing insights into creditworthiness and aiding decision-making processes.

## Key Highlights
Model Used: Logistic Regression
Class Imbalance Handling: SMOTE Tomek
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optuna
Performance Metrics
## 1. Decile Analysis
Top Deciles:
Decile 9: Event rate of 72.00%, non-event rate of 28.00%. The model is highly confident in predicting events.
Decile 8: Event rate of 12.72%, cumulative event rate reaching 98.6%.
Middle Deciles:
Deciles 7 and 6 show a significant drop in event rates.
Lower Deciles:
Deciles 5 to 0 have 0% events, indicating all predictions are non-events.
## 2. KS Statistic
Highest KS Value: 85.98% at Decile 8, showing the model performs best at distinguishing events and non-events in this range.
A KS value in the top 3 deciles and above 40% indicates a good predictive model.
## 3. AUC & Gini Coefficient
AUC: 0.98 - Excellent at distinguishing events from non-events.
Gini Coefficient: 0.96 - Indicates almost perfect rank-ordering capability.
## Tools & Techniques Used
Model Training: Logistic Regression
Imbalance Handling: SMOTE Tomek
Hyperparameter Optimization: Optuna
Evaluation Metrics: KS Statistic, AUC, Gini Coefficient, Decile Analysis
## Conclusion
The model is highly effective in predicting credit risk, demonstrated by:

High AUC (0.98) and Gini (0.96) scores.
Robust performance in top deciles with significant event rates.
Strong KS statistic in top deciles, meeting industry benchmarks for a good predictive model.

## Future Work
Extend model to include additional features for enhanced predictions.
Deploy the model for real-time credit risk assessments.
Explore ensemble methods to further improve classification accuracy.
